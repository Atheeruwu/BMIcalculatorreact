**BMI Calculator Explanation:**

This BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is designed to allow users to calculate their BMI by entering their height and weight. The application uses the following important techniques for its functionality:

1. **State Management with React's `useState` Hook**: 
   - The app manages user input (height and weight), calculation results (BMI), and status messages (e.g., underweight, normal weight, etc.) using React's `useState` hook.
   - Separate states are used for each piece of data, such as `height`, `weight`, `bmi`, `message`, and `bmiClass`, allowing the app to re-render with updated information as needed.
const [height, setHeight] = useState('');           // Tracks the user's input for height
const [weight, setWeight] = useState('');           // Tracks the user's input for weight
const [bmi, setBMI] = useState(null);               // Stores the calculated BMI value
const [message, setMessage] = useState('');         // Stores the message for BMI category
const [bmiClass, setBmiClass] = useState('');       // Tracks the CSS class for BMI result styling
const [animationClass, setAnimationClass] = useState(''); // Tracks the animation class for the result

2. **Event Handling**:
   - The `calculateBMI` function is triggered when the user submits the form, using React’s `onSubmit` event. It prevents the default form behavior with `e.preventDefault()` to ensure the page doesn’t reload.

   <form onSubmit={calculateBMI} className="mb-6">

   - The `resetForm` function is used to clear all inputs and results, providing a reset mechanism for the user.
<button
  onClick={resetForm}  // Event handling for reset button
  className="mt-4 px-6 py-2 bg-pink-300 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-pink-400 focus:outline-none"
>
  Reset
</button>


3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - After the BMI is calculated, conditional statements determine which category the BMI falls under (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese). These conditions are used to set the appropriate message and styling.
   - The logic compares the calculated BMI against predefined thresholds (e.g., BMI < 18.5 for underweight) and dynamically updates the display.

4. **Dynamic Styling with Conditional Classes**:
   - Depending on the BMI result, different CSS classes are applied for colors and animations using Tailwind CSS, such as `text-pink-400`, `text-pink-500`, etc.
   - The `animationClass` state adds an animated bounce effect using Tailwind’s `animate-bounce` class to catch the user’s attention when the BMI result is displayed.

5. **Form Validation**:
   - The app includes validation to ensure that the height and weight inputs are positive numbers before calculating the BMI. If invalid data is entered, an error message is displayed, and the corresponding text color is set to red (`text-red-500`).
